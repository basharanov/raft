This is a simple exercise. Its about a farmer who has N amount of sheeps and wants to cross a river with his sheeps. He need to build a raft that supports the weight of the sheeps, so he can cross the river K times with them. (We dont count the farmer's weigh and all the
times he need to come back and get the left over sheeps). For example he has 6 sheeps, they weight 26,10,30,7,4,5 and he wants to cross the river 2 times. This to happen he neeeds to build a raft that supports the wight of the sheeps that weight in total 42(26 + 7 + 4 + 5) 
and with this raft he can also take the other two because they in total they weight 40 (30 + 10).
